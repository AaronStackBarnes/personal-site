    <h2>Reduction Reactions</h2>
    <p>This page covers various reduction reactions commonly studied in organic chemistry courses, including the Birch reduction and related transformations.</p>

    <h3>Birch Reduction Overview</h3>
    <p>The Birch reduction is a named reaction that reduces aromatic rings using alkali metals in liquid ammonia. It was discovered by Arthur Birch in 1944.</p>

    <p>General applications include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Partial reduction of benzene rings</li>
      <li>Synthesis of 1,4-cyclohexadienes</li>
      <li>Reduction of various aromatic substrates</li>
    </ul>
