<main role="img" aria-label="A sweeping pastoral landscape at golden hour. Rolling green hills stretch toward distant mountains under a warm amber sky. A weathered wooden fence runs along a dirt path leading to a small red barn. Sheep graze peacefully in the meadow while a border collie rests in the shade of an old oak tree. Wildflowers dot the foreground - purple lavender, yellow buttercups, and white daisies swaying gently in the breeze. A narrow stream catches the sunlight as it winds through the valley. Birds circle overhead and the scene evokes a sense of timeless rural tranquility.">

<section aria-describedby="barn-desc">
<div id="barn-desc" hidden>The barn stands weathered but sturdy, its red paint faded to a warm russet. Double doors hang slightly open, revealing hay bales stacked inside. A rooster perches on the roof peak, silhouetted against the sky. Farm tools lean against the exterior wall - a pitchfork, shovel, and wooden ladder.</div>

<section aria-describedby="animals-desc">
<div id="animals-desc" hidden>Twelve merino sheep cluster near a stone water trough, their wool thick and cream-colored. Three lambs play nearby, leaping and chasing each other. The border collie watches attentively, black and white coat gleaming. In the distance, two horses graze in a separate paddock.</div>

<section aria-describedby="sky-desc">
<div id="sky-desc" hidden>The sky transitions from deep blue at the zenith through bands of orange and pink near the horizon. Wispy cirrus clouds catch the last light. The sun sits low, a glowing orb half-hidden behind the mountains. First stars begin appearing in the eastern sky.</div>
