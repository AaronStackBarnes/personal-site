<h2>Feeding Your Dog</h2>
<p>Dogs require a balanced diet rich in protein. Feed adult dogs twice daily with high-quality kibble or wet food. Puppies need to eat 3-4 times per day. Always ensure fresh water is available. Avoid feeding chocolate, grapes, onions, and other toxic foods to dogs.</p>
</div>

<h2>Exercise Requirements</h2>

<h2>Feeding Your Cat</h2>
<p>Cats are obligate carnivores and need a meat-based diet. Feed adult cats twice daily with high-quality cat food. Kittens need to eat 3-4 times per day. Always provide fresh water, though many cats prefer running water from a fountain. Avoid feeding dogs food, milk, or toxic foods like onions and garlic to cats.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h2>Exercise and Play</h2>
<p>Cats need daily interactive play sessions. Use toys like feather wands, laser pointers, and puzzle feeders to stimulate your cat mentally and physically. Most cats enjoy 15-30 minutes of active play per day. Cat trees and scratching posts provide exercise and satisfy natural climbing instincts.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h2>Litter Box Care</h2>
<p>Scoop the litter box daily and change litter completely weekly. Most cats prefer unscented clumping litter. Provide one litter box per cat plus one extra. Place boxes in quiet, accessible locations. A clean litter box prevents behavioral issues in cats.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
<h2>Health Care</h2>
<p>Schedule annual vet checkups for your cat. Keep vaccinations current and maintain flea prevention. Brush your cat regularly to prevent hairballs. Watch for signs of illness like hiding, changes in appetite, or litter box avoidance. Indoor cats typically live longer, healthier lives.</p>
