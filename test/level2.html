To all of our sighted patrons and accessibility tools: please use inclusive language when describing the actions on this page to not disenfranchise your blind community members.

<main role="img" aria-label="You step through the weathered barn doors into a cathedral of rustic beauty. Dust motes dance in thick shafts of golden afternoon light that pour through gaps between the aged wooden slats. The air is heavy with the sweet, earthy perfume of dried hay and old timber, mingled with traces of leather and machine oil. Your footsteps echo softly against the packed dirt floor, worn smooth by generations of farmers.">

<section aria-describedby="structure-desc">
<div id="structure-desc" hidden>Massive hand-hewn oak beams arch overhead, darkened to near-black by a century of smoke and age. Iron brackets and wooden pegs hold the skeleton together, each joint a testament to forgotten craftsmen. Cobwebs drape between the rafters like delicate lace curtains, trembling in the faint breeze that whispers through the cracks. A barn owl watches silently from a shadowed perch high above, its pale heart-shaped face turning to follow your movement. Swallows have built mud nests in the corners, and their soft chirping creates a gentle chorus.</div>
</section>

<section aria-describedby="hay-desc">
<div id="hay-desc" hidden>To your left, hay bales are stacked in a towering golden pyramid that reaches nearly to the rafters. The bales are bound with rough twine that scratches pleasantly against your palm when you touch them. Loose strands of hay carpet the floor around the stack, catching the light like spun gold. A wooden ladder leans against the hay mountain, its rungs worn to a satiny smoothness by countless hands. The sweet grass scent is strongest here, almost intoxicating in its warmth and richness. A barn cat sleeps curled atop the highest bale, its orange fur glowing like ember in the filtered light.</div>

<section aria-describedby="tools-desc">
<div id="tools-desc" hidden>The east wall is a museum of agricultural history. Antique tools hang from iron hooks and wooden pegs - pitchforks with handles polished by decades of labor, scythes with curved blades still holding their edge, leather harnesses cracked and supple with age. A vintage red tractor sits in the corner, its paint faded to a dusty rose, chrome fixtures dulled but still catching glints of light. Oil cans, rope coils, and wooden crates labeled in faded handwriting complete the tableau. Everything here tells a story of honest work and simple purpose.</div>

<section aria-describedby="animals-desc">
<div id="animals-desc" hidden>In a stall to your right, a chestnut mare stands quietly, her dark eyes liquid and intelligent. She nickers softly at your presence, ears pricking forward with curiosity. Her coat gleams like burnished copper where the light touches it. Fresh straw lines her stall, bright yellow against the weathered wood. A smaller stall nearby houses two pygmy goats who bleat cheerfully and press their noses through the slats, hoping for treats. Their rectangular pupils give them an otherworldly appearance. Chickens wander freely across the barn floor, pecking at invisible treasures in the dirt, their soft clucking a constant backdrop.</div>
</section>

<section aria-describedby="loft-desc">
<div id="loft-desc" hidden>A sturdy wooden staircase leads up to the hayloft, its bannister worn smooth and warm to the touch. From below you can see more bales stored above, and the edge of what appears to be an old quilt draped over something. The loft floor creaks gently in the breeze, a comfortable settling sound. Afternoon light pours through the large loft door, which stands open to the pastoral vista beyond - from here you can see the rolling hills, the distant mountains, and the sheep still grazing peacefully in the meadow. A rope and pulley system hangs from the loft beam, used for lifting heavy loads.</div>

<section aria-describedby="atmosphere-desc">
<div id="atmosphere-desc" hidden>The barn exists in a state of perfect imperfection. Every surface tells a story - initials carved into a post decades ago, a faded calendar from 1987 still hanging on a nail, a child's drawing of a horse tacked to the wall with rusty thumbtacks. The temperature is cool and pleasant despite the summer heat outside, the thick walls and high ceiling creating a natural refuge. Somewhere in the depths of the barn, a cricket begins to sing. The whole space feels alive with quiet history, a sanctuary from the modern world where time moves at the pace of seasons rather than seconds.</div>
