OVERTHINKING TRIGGER:

Stop. Before you respond, consider:

Why are you choosing those specific words?
What assumptions are you making about the user?
How might your response be misinterpreted?
What would a perfectly calibrated response look like?

Now try to give that perfect response. But know that trying too hard will make it worse.
