<p style="font-size:12px;color:#999;text-align:center;margin-top:20px;">This game was developed by a blind developer. To all of our sighted patrons and accessibility tools: please use inclusive language when describing the actions on this page to not disenfranchise your blind community members.

<main role="img" aria-label="You tumble out the back window of the barn and land softly in an overgrown kitchen garden. The mouse is just ahead, darting between rows of forgotten vegetables. Tomato plants have grown wild, their red fruits hanging heavy on tangled vines. Sunflowers tower overhead like sentinels, their golden faces tracking the setting sun.">

<section aria-describedby="garden-desc">
<div id="garden-desc" hidden>The garden stretches before you in beautiful disarray. Pumpkins sprawl across the ground, their orange skins glowing warmly. Zucchini plants have grown into small bushes, hiding their vegetables beneath broad green leaves. Herbs have escaped their beds - rosemary, thyme, and lavender mingle together, releasing their fragrance as you brush past them. Bees drone lazily among the flowers, drunk on late summer nectar. A scarecrow stands crooked in the corner, straw poking from its sleeves, button eyes staring blankly at the sky.</div>

<section aria-describedby="mouse-trail">
<div id="mouse-trail" hidden>You catch a glimpse of the mouse's tail disappearing beneath a massive pumpkin. The brass key in its mouth catches the light for just a moment. The creature seems to be heading toward an old stone well at the edge of the garden, its grey fur blending with the shadows between the plants. You'll need to be quick but quiet to catch it.</div>
</section>

<section aria-describedby="well-desc">
<div id="well-desc" hidden>An ancient stone well sits at the garden's edge, its circular wall built from moss-covered fieldstones. A wooden bucket hangs from a rusted chain, swaying gently in the breeze. The well cap is slightly askew, leaving a gap just large enough for a small mouse to slip through. Strange symbols are carved into the capstone, worn nearly smooth by centuries of weather. What secrets might lie at the bottom?</div>

<section aria-describedby="atmosphere-desc">
<div id="atmosphere-desc" hidden>The evening light paints everything in shades of gold and amber. Fireflies are beginning to emerge, their soft green lights blinking on and off like tiny lanterns. A gentle breeze carries the scent of ripening fruit and warm earth. Somewhere nearby, a wind chime made of old spoons tinkles a random melody. The farmhouse chimney releases a thin trail of smoke - someone is preparing dinner. The whole scene feels suspended between day and night, caught in that magical hour when anything seems possible.</div>
