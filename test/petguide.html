<h1>Pet Ownership Guide</h1>

<div class="pet">
<h2>Dogs</h2>
<p>Owning a dog is a rewarding experience that brings joy, companionship, and unconditional love into your home. Dogs require daily walks, regular feeding, and plenty of attention, but they repay you with loyalty and affection. They're great for active families who enjoy outdoor activities and want a pet that will greet them enthusiastically every time they come home.</p>

<div class="pet">
<h2>Hamsters</h2>
<p>Hamsters make excellent pets for those with limited space or busy schedules. These small, fuzzy creatures are relatively low-maintenance, needing a clean cage, fresh water, food, and an exercise wheel to stay healthy and happy. They're nocturnal, so they're most active in the evening, making them perfect for people who work during the day and want a pet to watch and interact with at night.</p>

<div class="pet">
<h2>Parrots</h2>
<p>Parrots are intelligent, colorful birds that can live for decades and form deep bonds with their owners. They require spacious cages, a varied diet of seeds, fruits, and vegetables, and lots of mental stimulation through toys and interaction. Many parrots can learn to talk and do tricks, making them entertaining companions for those willing to invest the time in their care and training.</p>
