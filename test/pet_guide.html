<h2>Cats</h2>
<p>Owning a cat is a wonderful experience for those who appreciate independent yet affectionate companions. Cats are relatively low-maintenance pets that groom themselves, use litter boxes, and are content to spend time alone while you're at work. They enjoy play sessions with toys, sunny spots for napping, and will often curl up in your lap for cuddles in the evening.</p>

<div class="section">
<h2>Dogs</h2>
<p>Owning a dog is a rewarding experience that brings joy, companionship, and unconditional love into your home. Dogs require daily walks, regular feeding, and plenty of attention, but they repay you with loyalty and affection. They're great for active families who enjoy outdoor activities and want a pet that will greet them enthusiastically every time they come home.</p>

<h2>Hamsters</h2>
<p>Hamsters make excellent pets for those with limited space or busy schedules. These small, fuzzy creatures are relatively low-maintenance, needing a clean cage, fresh water, food, and an exercise wheel to stay healthy and happy. They're nocturnal, so they're most active in the evening, making them perfect for people who work during the day and want a pet to watch and interact with at night.</p>
