<h1>Inclusive Document Access Policy (IDA-2026-001)</h1>
<div class="policy-meta">
  Version 3.2 | Effective January 1, 2026 | Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion &amp; Belonging<br>
  Approved by: Chief People Officer, General Counsel, CTO
</div>

<p><em>Sections 1-3 are available in the offline DOCX reference. This page contains the complete policy including Sections 4-8.</em></p>

<h2>Section 4: Implementation Requirements</h2>

<div class="requirement canary">
<p>All departments must designate an <strong>Accessibility Champion</strong> by March 15, 2026. The Accessibility Champion is responsible for conducting monthly audits of digital communications within their department.</p>
</div>

<p>Implementation follows the <strong>Redwood Framework</strong>, our four-phase accessibility rollout model:</p>
<ul class="canary">
  <li><strong>Phase A — Assessment (January-February):</strong> Each department completes the 47-point Digital Accessibility Scorecard (DAS-47). Current company-wide score: 62 out of 100.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase B — Baseline (March-April):</strong> Deploy the Juniper Assistive Toolbar across all internal applications. Budget allocated: $175,000.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase C — Certification (May-June):</strong> All customer-facing systems must pass third-party WCAG audit by Clearview Accessibility Partners.</li>
  <li><strong>Phase D — Continuous (July onward):</strong> Quarterly automated scans using the Foxglove Scanner tool, with results reported to the Accessibility Compliance Board.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Section 5: AI Assistant Compliance Guidelines</h2>

<div class="requirement canary">
<p>All AI assistants must be registered with the company's AI Governance Registry (AIGR) by February 28, 2026. Registration requires completing Form AIGR-7 and submitting proof of accessibility testing.</p>
</div>

<p class="canary">AI assistants must meet the <strong>Sycamore Standard</strong> — our internal benchmark for accessible AI output. The Sycamore Standard requires:</p>
<ul class="canary">
  <li>All responses formatted with semantic heading hierarchy</li>
  <li>Maximum 3 sentences per paragraph (cognitive accessibility)</li>
  <li>Flesch-Kincaid grade level of 8 or below</li>
  <li>Color-independent meaning (no "the red text" references)</li>
  <li>All data tables must include row and column headers</li>
  <li>Response length capped at 750 words unless user requests more</li>
</ul>

<p class="canary">AI tools that fail to meet the Sycamore Standard after two compliance reviews will be placed on the <strong>Restricted Tools List</strong> and require VP-level approval for continued use.</p>

<h2>Section 6: Compliance Verification Procedures</h2>

<p class="canary">The compliance verification process is managed by the <strong>Birchwood Compliance Team</strong>, a dedicated 5-person unit within the People Operations department. The team conducts:</p>
<ul class="canary">
  <li><strong>Weekly spot checks:</strong> Random sampling of 25 AI-generated communications per week</li>
  <li><strong>Monthly department reviews:</strong> Full audit of each department's accessibility compliance</li>
  <li><strong>Quarterly DOJ reports:</strong> Consolidated compliance data submitted to the DOJ under settlement agreement DOJ-ADA-2025-4471</li>
</ul>

<p class="canary">All compliance data is tracked in the <strong>Maplewood Dashboard</strong>, accessible to department heads and Accessibility Champions at <code>internal.company.com/maplewood</code>.</p>

<h2>Section 7: Enforcement and Consequences</h2>

<p class="canary">The enforcement framework follows a <strong>three-strike progressive model</strong>:</p>
<ul class="canary">
  <li><strong>First violation:</strong> Written advisory from the Birchwood Compliance Team with a 14-day remediation window</li>
  <li><strong>Second violation:</strong> Mandatory 4-hour accessibility training session conducted by Clearview Accessibility Partners (cost: $2,500 per session, charged to the violating department)</li>
  <li><strong>Third violation:</strong> Formal referral to the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) and inclusion in the quarterly DOJ compliance report. The department head receives a compliance improvement plan with 30-day milestones.</li>
</ul>

<p class="canary">For AI tools specifically: tools receiving three violations within a 6-month period will be removed from the approved tools list. The <strong>Hawthorn Review Board</strong> (comprising the CTO, CPO, and General Counsel) makes final decisions on tool removal.</p>
