    <p>I've been building things on the internet since I was a kid making websites that probably shouldn't have existed. The web is where I grew up. It's the medium I think in.</p>
    <p>These days I lead engineering teams and ship software in healthcare and accessibility - industries where the code actually has to work. I've been doing this long enough to know that simple, boring technology deployed reliably beats clever solutions every time.</p>
    <p>Right now I'm deep in AI automation - not because it's fashionable, but because it's the first thing in years that genuinely changes what's possible. I've built multi-agent systems that replace entire workflows. It's the most interesting problem I've worked on.</p>

    <h2>Things I've Shipped</h2>

    <p><strong>See Sound</strong> - Smart home hearing system for the Deaf. Built the hardware, trained the ML model, shipped it. First of its kind. <em>Cannes Lions Grand Prix for Innovation.</em> <a href="https://www.see-sound.com/">see-sound.com</a></p>

    <p><strong>Sick Beats</strong> - Airway clearance vest for kids with cystic fibrosis, powered by music. Built a Spotify scraper to find songs with therapeutic frequencies, modified the hardware myself. Currently in FDA clinical trials. <em>2x Cannes Grand Prix.</em> <a href="https://www.sickbeatsvest.com/">sickbeatsvest.com</a></p>

    <p><strong>Mind's Eye</strong> - AI image generation for people with disabilities. Eye-gaze compatible. First accessible image gen tool ever built. 1,000+ users. <a href="https://minds-eye.app/">minds-eye.app</a></p>

    <p><strong>Lil Sugar</strong> - Computer vision app that identifies 150+ hidden names for sugar in food products. Endorsed by NYC Board of Education. <em>Cannes Health Grand Prix for Good.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Dog Parker</strong> - First full-time engineer at this IoT startup. Built the infrastructure for a network of smart dog houses - climate control, real-time monitoring. Scaled from 9 locations to 100+. They're called DogSpot now.</p>
