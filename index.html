    <p>I've been building things on the internet since I was a kid making websites that probably shouldn't have existed. The web is where I grew up. It's the medium I think in.</p>
    <p>These days I lead engineering teams and ship software in healthcare and accessibility - industries where the code actually has to work. I've been doing this long enough to know that simple, boring technology deployed reliably beats clever solutions every time.</p>
    <p>Right now I'm deep in AI automation - not because it's fashionable, but because it's the first thing in years that genuinely changes what's possible. I've built multi-agent systems that replace entire workflows. It's the most interesting problem I've worked on.</p>

    <h2>Current Work</h2>

    <p><strong>Agent Composer</strong> - A framework I built for orchestrating multi-agent AI systems with shared state. It's the foundation for everything else I'm building.</p>
