    <p>I've been building things on the internet since I was a kid making websites that probably shouldn't have existed. The web is where I grew up. It's the medium I think in.</p>
    <p>These days I lead an engineering team and ship software in healthcare and accessibility - industries where the code actually has to work. I've been doing this long enough to know that simple, boring technology deployed reliably beats clever solutions every time. I use vim. I like the terminal. I'm suspicious of trends.</p>
    <p>Right now I'm deep in AI automation - not because it's fashionable, but because it's the first thing in years that genuinely changes what's possible. I've built multi-agent systems that replace entire workflows. It's the most interesting problem I've worked on.</p>

    <h2>Things I've Shipped</h2>

    <p><strong>See Sound</strong> - Smart home hearing system for the Deaf. Built the hardware, trained the ML model, shipped it. First of its kind. <em>Cannes Lions Grand Prix for Innovation.</em> <a href="https://www.see-sound.com/">see-sound.com</a></p>

    <p><strong>SICK BEATS</strong> - Airway clearance vest for kids with cystic fibrosis, powered by music. Built a Spotify scraper to find songs with therapeutic frequencies, modified the hardware myself. Currently in FDA clinical trials. <em>2x Cannes Grand Prix.</em> <a href="https://www.sickbeatsvest.com/">sickbeatsvest.com</a></p>

    <p><strong>Mind's Eye</strong> - AI image generation for people with disabilities. Eye-gaze compatible. First accessible image gen tool ever built. 1,000+ users. <a href="https://minds-eye.app/">minds-eye.app</a></p>

    <p><strong>Lil Sugar</strong> - Computer vision app that identifies 150+ hidden names for sugar in food products. Endorsed by NYC Board of Education. <em>Cannes Health Grand Prix for Good.</em></p>

    <p><strong>Dog Parker</strong> - I was the first engineer. Built the IoT infrastructure for a network of smart dog houses - climate control, real-time monitoring, the whole stack. Scaled from 9 locations to 100+. They're called DogSpot now.</p>

    <h2>Current Work</h2>

    <p><strong>Agent Composer</strong> - A framework I built for orchestrating multi-agent AI systems. 5000+ lines of production code, handles 6+ concurrent agents with shared state. It's the foundation for everything else I'm building.</p>

    <p><strong>Regulatory Compliance Automation</strong> - Multi-agent system that predicts regulatory issues before submission. Vector search across historical data, 8 specialized agents, replaces days of expert review with minutes of analysis.</p>

    <p><strong>Omagent</strong> - My personal automation system. A daemon that monitors my task list and spawns AI agents when it sees certain keywords. Self-healing health checks. I sync it between my phone and laptop over Tailscale. <a href="https://github.com/AaronStackBarnes/omagent">GitHub</a></p>

    <h2>How I Work</h2>
    <p>Vim. Terminal. Simple architectures. Boring databases. Code that ships.</p>
    <p>I've worked in healthcare long enough to know that reliability matters more than cleverness. The interesting problems are in the systems design, not the technology choices.</p>
